Before running, make sure `tkinter` is installed on your system. It should be part of the standard Python library on Windows and MacOS. Note that for MacOS, if you have installed Python via `homebrew`, then `tkinter` is usually not included.

To install `tkinter` on MacOS for Python installed via homebrew, run:
```
brew install python-tk
```

To install `tkinter` on Linux, run:

```
apt-get install python-tk
```

To test if you have a working version of `tkinter` on your system, try running:

```
python -m tkinter
```

If it brings up a GUI window, then you have `tkinter` installed.
